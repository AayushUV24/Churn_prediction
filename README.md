# Customer Churn Prediction using Deep Learning in Python

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using deep learning techniques in Python. The model utilizes libraries such as TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and NumPy to preprocess data, train a neural network, and evaluate performance.

## Features
- Data preprocessing using Pandas and Scikit-Learn
- Feature selection and scaling
- Building and training a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Visualization of results

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Libraries
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## Dataset
The dataset should contain customer information such as demographics, account activity, and subscription history. Ensure it is in CSV format before processing.

## Usage
1. **Load Dataset**: Read the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and normalize numerical data.
3. **Model Training**: Train a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras.
4. **Evaluation**: Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict customer churn.

## Running the Project
```sh
python main.py
```

## Results
After training, the model outputs evaluation metrics and visualizations of customer churn predictions.
